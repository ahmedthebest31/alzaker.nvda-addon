# alzaker

A NVDA ScreenReader add-on that reminds users of Islamic remembrances. Users can receive these reminders in multiple ways: spoken, audio, and Windows notifications, randomly at a user-specified interval.

## Features

* **Read the remembrance using NVDA's default TTS.**
* **Speak the remembrance using recorded audio files.**
* **Display the remembrance in Windows notifications.**
* The reminders are presented randomly at an interval specified by the user from the settings page.
* Additionally, users can trigger a random remembrance using the shortcut `NVDA+Alt+Z`.
* You can also **copy the last spoken remembrance to the system clipboard** with `NVDA+Alt+X`.
    These shortcuts can be changed via `NVDA > Preferences > Input gestures > alzaker`.
