# alzaker.nvda-addon 

An NVDA ScreenReader add-on that reminds users of Islamic remembrances. Users can receive these reminders in multiple ways:

- Read the remembrance using NVDA's default TTS.
- Speak the remembrance using recorded audio files.
- Display the remembrance in Windows notifications.

The reminders are presented randomly at an interval specified by the user. Additionally, users can trigger a random remembrance using the shortcut `nvda+alt+Z`. This shortcut can be changed via `nvda > Preferences > Input gestures > alzaker`.
